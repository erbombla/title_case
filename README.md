## Title Case with BDD!

Using the previous lessons as reference, create a Ruby method on the String class that takes a string of word(s) from the user and returns it in title case.

Write plain English versions of your specs first.

Don't be tempted to cut and paste the Title Case code you've seen. Talk through what behaviors need to be built and write tests for each one at a time. Create code to make each pass before moving to the next behavior/spec.

Final Check: Before moving onto the next exercise, have a teacher review your final code and specs.
